# Integrating Testing and Security Frameworks - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive Movie Rating API that demonstrates advanced testing methodologies and security framework integration using FastAPI. This project focuses on implementing multiple testing strategies including unit testing, integration testing, and security testing while incorporating modern security practices such as JWT authentication, password hashing, and vulnerability assessment for production-ready applications.

## Project Objectives

1. **Testing Framework Integration:** Master multiple testing methodologies including unit testing, integration testing, and API testing using pytest, unittest, and FastAPI TestClient for comprehensive application validation.

2. **Security Framework Implementation:** Implement robust security frameworks including JWT authentication, password hashing with bcrypt, and input validation to protect against common vulnerabilities and security threats.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment:** Learn security testing practices including penetration testing, static code analysis, and dependency vulnerability scanning using tools like bandit and safety.

4. **API Security Testing:** Design and implement comprehensive API security testing strategies that validate authentication, authorization, and input sanitization across all endpoints.

5. **Authentication and Authorization:** Build secure user management systems with JWT token-based authentication and role-based access control for protected resources.

6. **Security Best Practices:** Integrate industry-standard security practices including secure password storage, token management, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.

## Key Features to Implement

- Comprehensive testing framework integration with unit tests, integration tests, and security tests using pytest and unittest
- JWT-based authentication system with secure token generation, validation, and expiration handling for stateless authentication
- Password security implementation using bcrypt hashing with automatic salt generation and secure storage practices
- Input validation and sanitization using Pydantic models to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity
- Security testing framework with vulnerability assessment including SQL injection, XSS prevention, and boundary testing
- API endpoint security with protected routes, proper authorization, and comprehensive error handling for unauthorized access

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **Testing Methodologies:** Understanding different testing approaches including unit testing for individual functions, integration testing for complete workflows, and security testing for vulnerability assessment
- **Security Framework Integration:** Learning how to integrate multiple security frameworks and tools including authentication systems, validation frameworks, and vulnerability scanners
- **JWT Implementation:** Mastering JSON Web Token creation, validation, expiration handling, and secure token management in stateless authentication systems
- **Password Security:** Implementing secure password handling including bcrypt hashing, salt generation, verification, and protection against common password-based attacks
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Understanding and implementing security testing practices including penetration testing, static analysis, and dependency scanning
- **API Security Testing:** Building comprehensive API security testing strategies that validate authentication flows, authorization controls, and input sanitization
- **Framework Integration:** Seamlessly integrating testing frameworks (pytest, unittest) with security frameworks (JWT, bcrypt) and external tools (bandit, safety)

## Expected Outcome

You will create a production-ready Movie Rating API that demonstrates comprehensive testing and security framework integration. The system will showcase modern testing methodologies including unit testing, integration testing, and security testing while implementing robust security measures including JWT authentication, password hashing, and vulnerability prevention that can serve as a foundation for secure, well-tested web applications.

## Additional Considerations
